## Classification model used in “Highly accurate multi-domain deep ensemble model to detect neurological disorder symptoms with soft skin-attachable throat vibration sensor” reported in npj Digital Medicine.


Abstract: 
Most of neurological disorders lead to throat-related sequelae such as dysphagia and dysarthria. 
These impairments require personalized treatment and rehabilitation due to variations in the patient's anamnesis, severity of symptoms, and environmental factors. 
However, conventional treatments were performed by medical professional in specialized clinical settings, which limits continuous monitoring of patient conditions. 
In this study, we propose an innovative place-independent medical system for autonomously detecting neurological disorder symptoms through a soft skin-attachable throat vibration sensor (SVS). 
The SVS precisely records the throat vibration with minimal interference from surrounding noise. 
Additionally, we significantly enhance the accuracy of discerning neurological signs from throat vibrations by devising an ensemble-based deep learning model. 
The proposed model integrates multiple deep neural networks trained in both time and frequency domains based on a stacking ensemble algorithm. 
The classification accuracy of 95.96% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) exceeding 0.99 outperform previous researches in the field of throat vibration classification. 
Our innovative system stands as a pivotal advancement in neurotherapy, offering continuous and precise monitoring of patient conditions, thereby substantially improving the efficacy of rehabilitation strategies and paving the way for superior patient care in neurological disorders.
